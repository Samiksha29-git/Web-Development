The repository contains all the essential HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files required to build a website. While it is not a fully functional website, it serves as a practical implementation of my learning over the past three months.

The project includes various exciting features, such as an interactive login page, creative scrollbars, smooth transitions, and engaging animations. These elements demonstrate my growing expertise in front-end development. Additionally, I explored backend integration, connecting the front end to a basic backend system to deepen my understanding of full-stack development.

This project is a showcase of my progress and dedication to learning web development, highlighting creative designs and interactive functionalities Iâ€™ve implemented along the way.
